                    <span>I am a artist. A artist is a person who enjoys practicing there creativity though a range of different mediums on different types of canvases, no matter the skill set of that person. When you hear the word artist you think of a person who draws,and paints every chance they get because they love the idea of creating something new.</span>

I am Strong-willed as I am true to my word and willing to take any challenges in life. Take the time to help other people without expecting a reward or gratitude is definitely important in living an optimistic life.</span>

                    <span>for me being helpful is one of my strongest point because helping is also not easy when you are jugling with your academics, life, and extra curriculars. And there are times that people might take you in a wrong side by misunderstanding your way of helping.</span>

For all of their life people treated them harshly. They are always being told “Why are you so emotional?”  “You are over reacting.” Society with lack of understanding about highly sensitive persons is an awful thing for those people who are suffering from that condition. </span>

                    <span>When I think about myself, as a math learner one thing that I know is very important is low stress. Growing up during Elementary school, Middle school and high school I always enjoyed math and found it to be a very interesting and relaxing subject. Once I began taking AP Calculus during my senior year of high school I saw my stress level start to raise and my retention of information and my engagement with understanding the material versus just getting the right answer drop. I became fixated with having the right answers even if I did not understand how the math worked</span>

                    <span>I found out in my experience of getting bullied in school and seeing my friends being bullied in highschool and Internet, that the average bully is not very smart. You see, when someone bullies, they are usually doing this out of sheer ego. This dominant behavior pattern, makes them underestimate their victims. STOP BULLYING!!!</span>
